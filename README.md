# ClimateWins-ML-Prediction

ML analysis of European weather data to predict climate patterns

---

## Project Overview
ClimateWins uses machine learning to analyze historical European weather data. The goal is to predict extreme events and day-to-day weather conditions while addressing ethical considerations such as regional biases, anonymization, and responsible use of predictions. This project demonstrates ML modeling, optimization, and predictive analytics on climate data.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preparation:** Cleaning and organizing temperature and weather data.  
2. **Gradient Descent:** Modeling temperature trends across decades.  
3. **KNN Model:** Predicting pleasant/unpleasant days across multiple stations.  
4. **Decision Tree:** Quick interpretability of predictions.  
5. **Artificial Neural Network (ANN):** Most robust model for predicting pleasant days across stations.  
6. **Ethical Considerations:** Mitigating regional and historical biases, anonymizing station data, and maintaining human oversight of predictions.

## Key Insights
- Gradient Descent converges reliably across different climates and stations.  
- ANN (Scenario 3) performs best overall in predicting pleasant days.  
- Winter minimum temperatures show a long-term warming trend across Europe.  
- Regional biases and gaps in historical data must be considered when interpreting predictions.
